## Functional Requirements

#### Task Management 
The system must allow users to create, edit, delete, and list tasks.
Reminders and Notifications: Users should be able to set reminders for tasks, with the system notifying them at the specified times.
#### Integration 
The application should integrate with Outlook Calendar for due dates and OneNote for task notes, seamlessly syncing data across services.
#### Search and Filter 
Users must be able to search for tasks and filter them based on criteria like due date, priority, or completion status.

## Non-Functional Requirements
_Non-functional requirements describe how the system performs certain actions and constraints under which it operates. They are crucial for usability, performance, and maintainability._

#### Usability
The GUI should be intuitive, allowing new users to become proficient with minimal training. Accessibility for users with disabilities must be considered.
#### Performance
The application should respond to user inputs without noticeable delays, handling a large number of tasks efficiently.
#### Security 
User data, including tasks and personal information, must be securely stored and transmitted, especially when integrating with external services.
#### Portability
The application should be easily deployable across various operating systems without significant modifications.

## Modules to Consider
Expanding on the system architecture to address these requirements involves detailing the components and their interactions further:

#### Front-End Layer
The GUI, designed with user experience principles, accommodating various user actions and displaying information in an organized manner.
#### Business Logic Layer
Handles the application's core functionalities, including task management logic, reminders, and integration services.
#### Data Access Layer
Manages communication with the database for storing and retrieving task information and user settings.
Integration Layer: Facilitates communication with external services like Outlook and OneNote, ensuring data consistency across platforms.

## Design and Development Considerations (High-Level)
#### Adaptive Design
The GUI should be responsive to different device sizes and orientations, ensuring a consistent user experience on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
#### Modular Development
Adopt a modular approach in developing features, allowing for independent testing, maintenance, and future enhancements without impacting other system parts.
#### Collaborative Tools 
Will use github for source control and project management, ensuring that the team can work together effectively and maintain a clear record of changes and contributions. Will use github project boards to organize tasks and track progress.

## Quality Assurance
#### Testing Strategy 
Implement a comprehensive testing strategy that includes unit testing for individual components, integration testing for system parts interaction, and user acceptance testing to validate the application against user requirements.
