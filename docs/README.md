# UVU TODO Application

The UVU TODO Application is a graphical user interface (GUI) based task management tool designed specifically for educational purposes. It is developed as a sample project for the CS2450 class at Utah Valley University (UVU) to provide students with a practical example of software development, from conception through to implementation, following the guidelines and principles taught in the course. This application aims to demonstrate the basics of GUI application development, including task management functionalities such as adding, viewing, editing, and deleting tasks.

Please note that this project is intended solely for educational use. The files and contents provided are examples and, as such, lack the comprehensive details you would expect in a full-scale application. This project serves as a learning aid for CS2450 students, offering a hands-on experience in software engineering practices.

## Features

- **Task Management**: Users can add, view, edit, and delete tasks.
- **GUI Interface**: A user-friendly graphical interface for interacting with the application.
- **Educational Framework**: Designed to align with the CS2450 class curriculum, focusing on software development principles.

## Installation and Setup

As this is a sample project, detailed installation and setup instructions are beyond the scope of this README. However, students are encouraged to explore the application's source code to understand the structure and functionalities of a basic GUI application.

## Contributing

This project is designed for educational purposes and is not intended for full-scale development. However, students are encouraged to experiment with the code, add new features, and make improvements as part of their learning experience. Please follow the best practices and guidelines taught in the CS2450 class and your common sense when making any changes.

## Limitations

The UVU TODO Application is a simplified project, and as such, it does not include all the functionalities you might find in a comprehensive task management tool. It is intended to serve as a starting point for learning about GUI application development and is not suitable for commercial use or deployment.
