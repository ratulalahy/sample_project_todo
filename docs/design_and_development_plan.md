## Design and Development Plan (Details)

#### Step 1: Define the Scope and Objectives üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è

**Objective:**  
Our main goal is to build a graphical user interface (GUI) application that makes managing tasks easy and efficient. This app will let users handle their daily to-dos with essential features, all through a user-friendly GUI. We aim to prove that managing tasks can be simple and visually appealing with this prototype.

**Scope:**  
This prototype will:
- Use a GUI, making it user-friendly and accessible on different operating systems, without relying solely on text-based commands.
- Include key features for managing tasks, like adding, viewing, completing tasks, and keeping tasks saved between uses.

#### Step 2: Identify Key Functionalities üì•

1. **Add Task**:  
   Allows users to enter a new task with details such as title, an optional description, and a due date through a form in the GUI.

2. **View Tasks**:  
   Users can see a list of their tasks, showing titles, descriptions, due dates, and which tasks are finished or pending.

3. **Complete Task**:  
   Lets users mark a task as done. This changes the task's status to show it's completed.

4. **Save and Load Tasks**:  
   Ensures users' tasks are saved and can be loaded the next time they open the app, so no task is lost when the app is closed and reopened.

#### Step 3: Design the User Interface ‚úèÔ∏è

The app will have a graphical interface that is straightforward and easy to use. Here's what it will include:

- **Main Window**: This is where users will spend most of their time. It will show a list of tasks and buttons for adding a new task, editing, or deleting tasks.

- **Adding Tasks**: When users want to add a task, they'll click an "Add Task" button. This will open a new window where they can type in their task's details and save it.

- **Editing Tasks**: By selecting a task and clicking an "Edit" button, users can change the task's details in a new window that pops up.

- **Completing Tasks**: Next to each task will be a checkbox. When users finish a task, they can check this box, and the task will move to a "Completed" section.

- **Menu Options**: The app will have a simple menu for extra options like "Save Tasks", "Load Tasks", and "Exit".

- **Error Messages**: If something goes wrong, like missing a task title, the app will show a friendly message explaining what needs to be fixed.

#### Step 4: Plan for Data Management üíæ

**Task Representation:**  
For our GUI application, we'll keep track of tasks with clear details:
- **Title**: Every task has a name.
- **Description** (optional): More info about what needs to be done.
- **Due Date** (optional): When the task should be finished, in a simple date format like YYYY-MM-DD.
- **Completion Status**: Shows if a task is done or not, using simple terms like `pending` or `completed`.

This setup makes sure we know everything important about each task, making them easy to manage and show in the app.

**Storage:**  
To save tasks, we'll use formats like JSON or CSV because they're simple and work well with most programming languages:
- **JSON** is great for details and can handle more complex info if we add features later.
- **CSV** is super straightforward, perfect for a list of tasks and can even be opened in spreadsheet programs.

We'll make a part of the app specifically for saving and loading these tasks, so nothing gets lost when the app is closed and reopened.

#### Step 5: Consider Future Expansion üí≠

- **Modular Design**: We're building our app in parts (like lego blocks) so we can easily add new things later without having to redo everything. This could be new ways to sort tasks, reminders, or working with calendars.
- **Documentation**: We'll write down how we made the app and why we made it that way. This helps anyone who works on the app in the future understand it quickly, including what each part of the code does and how to use any tools or outside code we included.

#### Step 6: Collaborative Development Plan üñáÔ∏è

**Divide Responsibilities ‚öñÔ∏è :**  
Our team will share the work, with each person focusing on what they're best at:
- **Interface Design**: Making the app easy and pleasant to use.
- **Data Management**: Setting up how tasks are saved, loaded, and organized.
- **Testing**: Checking that everything in the app works as it should, catching any mistakes.

We'll make sure everyone has a clear part to play in both adding new stuff and keeping the app running smoothly.

**Source Control:**  
We're using GitHub to keep track of all the changes to our code. It lets us work together better by reviewing each other's code before it becomes part of the project and helps us keep track of different versions of the app as we develop it. We'll set up our project with a clear guide on how to contribute, and organize our work with branches for each new feature or fix.

**Regular Check-ins:**  
We'll have regular meetings to talk about how the project is going, any problems we're running into, and what we'll do next. These check-ins make sure everyone knows what's happening, can ask for help if they need it, and can share their ideas for the app.

Following these steps, we're making sure our GUI-based task management app is not just easy and fun to use but also ready for anything new we want to add later. This plan keeps our work organized and helps everyone stay on the same page, making our development process smooth and efficient.

### Step 7: Testing Strategy for GUI-Based Application üß™

**Manual Testing Approach:**

- **Simulate User Interactions**: Testers will interact with the graphical interface just like users would, performing tasks such as creating, editing, and deleting tasks using the GUI elements. This ensures the app is user-friendly and functions as expected.
- **Test Environment Setup**: Set up testing environments that reflect the variety of systems users might have, including different operating systems and screen sizes, to ensure the GUI is responsive and functional across all platforms.

**Development of Test Cases:**

- **Normal Usage**: Develop scenarios that cover everyday use of the app, such as:
  - Creating tasks with different levels of detail.
  - Viewing tasks in various sorts and filters.
  - Marking tasks as complete using the GUI controls.
- **Edge Cases**: Test unusual scenarios to check the app's robustness, like:
  - Creating tasks for leap days or invalid dates.
  - Inputting excessively long task titles or descriptions.
  - Trying to mark a non-existent task as complete.
- **Error Conditions**: Evaluate the app's handling of errors, for instance:
  - Input validation for dates and required fields.
  - Handling unsaved changes when closing the app or navigating away.

**Documentation of Testing Procedures:**

- Create a clear, step-by-step testing guide that outlines how to perform each test case, what the expected results are, and how to log observations. This guide will help ensure consistent and comprehensive testing.

### Step 8: Documentation for GUI-Based Application üì∞

**Prototype Design and Functionality:**

- **Overview**: Offer a brief description of the app, highlighting its key features and how it stands out from other task management tools, focusing on its graphical interface.
- **Technical Architecture**: Explain the app's structure, including how the GUI is built, the backend logic, and how data is stored and retrieved, emphasizing any frameworks or libraries used.

**User Instructions**:
- Write a user manual with screenshots and step-by-step instructions on using the app, covering all features from basic task management to any advanced functionalities. Make sure this manual is easy to understand for all potential users.

**Guide for Future Development**:
- Provide a detailed account of the app‚Äôs code organization and architecture, making it easier for future developers to understand the project and contribute to it.
- Include guidelines for contributing to the project, such as coding conventions, the process for submitting changes, and how to report bugs.
- Outline potential areas for expansion or improvement, considering user feedback and technological advancements.

**Team Contributions**:
- Document each team member's contributions, ensuring everyone's work is recognized. This includes coding, design, testing, and documentation.
- This record not only highlights team efforts but also provides a comprehensive view of the project's collaborative nature.
